Description: `edgyr.algocompsynth` is a collection of utilities
    for algorithmic music composition and digital sound synthesis. The design
    goals include taking advantage of NVIDIA CUDA capabilities when present, for
    either NVIDIA Jetson systems or PCs with CUDA-aware GPUs. If it will run
    `cuSignal`, it should run `edgyr.algocompsynth`.
