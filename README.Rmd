# edgyR.algocompsynth

CUDA-aware algorithmic composition and digital sound synthesis in R

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `algocompsynth` is to provide functions for algorithmic music
composition and digital sound synthesis in R. `algocompsynth` will extend
the packages described in
[Sueur, Jérôme (2018), _Sound Analysis and Synthesis with R_](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319776453)
with functions to access
NVIDIA GPUs via CUDA on any CUDA-capable system including Jetsons, functions
for multi-core parallel processing, and functions for algorithmic composition.

## Installation

You can install `edgyR.algocompsynth` from
[GitHub](https://edgyR.github.io/edgyR.algocompsynth) with:

``` r
remotes::install_.packages_github("edgyR/edgyR.algocompsynth")
```
