# edgyr.algocompsynth

CUDA-aware algorithmic composition and digital sound synthesis in R

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:
experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `algocompsynth` is to provide functions for algorithmic
music composition and digital sound synthesis in R. `algocompsynth` will
extend the packages described in [Sueur, Jérôme (2018), *Sound Analysis
and Synthesis with R*](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319776453)
with functions to access NVIDIA GPUs via CUDA on any CUDA-capable system
including Jetsons, functions for multi-core parallel processing, and
functions for algorithmic composition.

## Installation

You can install `edgyr.algocompsynth` from
[GitHub](https://edgyR.github.io/edgyr.algocompsynth) with:
